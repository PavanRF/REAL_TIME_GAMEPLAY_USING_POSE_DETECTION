# 🎮 REAL_TIME_GAMEPLAY_USING_POSE_DETECTION

## 📘 About the Project
The **REAL_TIME_GAMEPLAY_USING_POSE_DETECTION** project is a Python-based application that enables players to control a video game using their **body movements**. Using **computer vision** and **pose detection** technologies, it converts physical actions into in-game commands — creating a fun, immersive, and hands-free gaming experience.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Pose Detection:** Detects and tracks body keypoints using advanced computer vision algorithms.  
- **Motion-Based Controls:** Maps body gestures to specific game actions.  
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Offers a new and engaging way to play games without traditional controllers.  
- **Customizable Controls:** Easily modify pose mappings for different games or gestures.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Camera Input:** The system captures live video through a connected webcam.  
2. **Pose Detection:** Each frame is analyzed to detect key body joints using pose estimation models.  
3. **Control Mapping:** Recognized poses or gestures are translated into corresponding game commands.  
4. **Gameplay:** These commands are used to control the game in real time through body movements.
